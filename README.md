The aim of this coursework is to develop an Internet of Things (IoT) data processing pipeline that processes
sensor data in an edge-cloud environment. The pipeline will be designed to perform opera􀆟ons such as
data collec􀆟on, preprocessing, visualiza􀆟on, and predic􀆟on by leveraging lightweight virtualiza􀆟on
technology, specifically Docker. This setup will enable the integra􀆟on of edge and cloud resources to
support the implementa􀆟on of a machine learning-based IoT pipeline, ul􀆟mately facilita􀆟ng air quality
predic􀆟ons from urban data.
